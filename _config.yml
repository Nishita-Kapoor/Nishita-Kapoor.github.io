  I developed my interest in data science during the Covid pandemic. I was fascinated by the insights we can get from the data and applications of AI to biomedical
  industry such as in diagnostics etc. I have a Master's in Biotechnology and extensive biomedical research experience. Being passionate about the healthcare industry,
  I was excited about gaining these new skills and started on this new path towards data science. 
  Since pursuing this goal of Data Science I have learned that I love problem solving. This is why I have fully switched into pursuing the Data Science industry,
  and I aspire to be on the forefront developing algorithms in all aspects of Artificial Intelligence.
  Although I am a long way away from that goal, I strive to learn as much as I can in all aspects of the Data Cycle. I obtained deep understanding of Data Science
  and Machine Learning concepts and tools through various courses and personal projects.

   I am now seeking opportunities where I can leverage AI and data science to solve problems in the biotechnology/healthcare industry and result in translational advancements.
